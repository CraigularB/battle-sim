# Heroes Battle Sim
**Michael Kristofik** ([kristo605@gmail.com](mailto:kristo605@gmail.com))

This game was inspired by the turn-based combat of the Heroes of Might and Magic and Disciples fantasy strategy games.  It is a sandbox to experiment with various battle mechanics to learn what's fun, and what isn't.

## Core Principles

- Be simple enough that an AI player can play well.
- All units move 1 hex per turn by default.
- All attacks must do at least *some* damage.  No abilities may cause an attack to miss entirely.
- Most creatures should have a special ability.  Special attacks take the place of a normal (boring) attack.
- Special abilities must be **special**.  Anything that reduces to a numerical increase in damage or hit points is not special.
- Magic should be **magical**.  Direct-damage spells (e.g., Fireball, Lightning) are boring, and not very effective as stack sizes get larger.
- Good spells should have a large-scale effect.  Spells that affect the entire battlefield indiscriminantly are even better.
